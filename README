Installation via Cabal.

There are three displays to choose from, depending on
the flags passed to Setup configure:

  * gtk2hs  (the default)
  * vty     (Setup configure -f-gtk)
  * curses  (Setup configure -fcurses)

The curses display is the newest and least tested,
the other two should be stable.
